#whatsyourstory.dev

#What this Repo is for?
This repo is created for the new learning developers. The main aim here is to get comfortable with GIT and learn some other stuff as well like Jekyll themes.

#What does this repo offer exactly?
This repo is introduction to the Github Pages for the new guys. We have bought a custom domain ##whatsyourstory.dev and anyone can put up a page up there by raising a pull request.

#What can you post or raise a pull request for?
Try to write how you got into the development world. I wouldn't recommend to put up your Resumes there but you can put up your aspirations or inspirational stories or some anecdotes relating to dev.

#Are there any rules for raising a pull request?
Yes, everone should follow the directory structure. If you have a name for your page, you can name it as your github handle. For eg - I have a username as drekhi12 and my page name woould be like drekhi12.html. Also, we will be reviewing the content as well.

#Why the rules?
The naming rule is for faster approval of the pull requests as it will become cumbersome if more than uses the same name for the page. Also, we expect the content to not fall under the category of ##NSFW.
